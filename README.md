# Grokking Coding Interview Progress Tracker

Welcome to the Grokking Coding Interview Progress Tracker! This repository is designed to help me track the progress in the Grokking Coding Interview course. It provides a structured way to organize your solutions to coding interview questions based on the patterns covered in the course.

Feel free to update this repository as you progress through the course and solve the coding interview questions. Use the provided files to document your solutions and keep track of your learning journey.

## Course Overview

The course is based on the [Grokking Coding Interview Patterns](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-cpp) course on Educative. It covers essential patterns that will enable you to unpack and answer any problem the right way, just by assessing the problem statement. These patterns were created by FAANG hiring managers to help you prepare for the typical rounds of interviews at major tech companies like Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon.

## Objectives

In this repository, you will find solutions to coding interview questions based on the patterns covered in the course. Each topic is organized into separate files, making it easy for you to navigate and find the specific problem you want to practice.

Here are the topics covered in this repository:

1. [Pattern 1: Sliding Window](./sliding-window.md)
2. [Pattern 2: Two Pointers]( /Two%20Pointers/two-pointers.md)
3. [Pattern 3: Fast and Slow Pointers](./fast-slow-pointers.md)
4. [Pattern 4: Merge Intervals](./merge-intervals.md)
5. [Pattern 5: Cyclic Sort](./cyclic-sort.md)
6. [Pattern 6: In-place Reversal of a LinkedList](./in-place-reversal-of-a-linkedlist.md)
7. [Pattern 7: Tree Breadth First Search](./tree-breadth-first-search.md)
8. [Pattern 8: Tree Depth First Search](./tree-depth-first-search.md)
9. [Pattern 9: Two Heaps](./two-heaps.md)
10. [Pattern 10: Subsets](./subsets.md)

Feel free to explore each topic and practice solving the coding interview questions associated with them.

## Additional Resources

If you prefer learning in other programming languages, the course is also available in JavaScript, Java, Python, and Go. You can find the respective repositories for each language on the [Grokking Coding Interview Patterns](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-cpp) course page.

Good luck with your coding interview preparation! Remember to practice regularly and apply the patterns you learn to solve different types of problems.
